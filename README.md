scripts for moviedb
<br>

In order to run the solution you insert your password into the password variable in either *setup.sh*(mac/linux) or *setup.ps1*(windows). Then you run the desired script acording to your OS.
- It is assumed that you have a local postgres server running with a user called postgres.
- You can provide "big" as an argument to either script, and it will download the big version of the database and use that instead.
